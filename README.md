 LHBOS is a bookmarklet inspired by Inject0r, and works as a way to use unblocked games, apps, and more!
  What can it do? Well, here are its features:<br><br>
  • An app library, filled with all the apps you need.<br>
  • [WIP] An auto-cloaker built into the bookmarklet.<br>
  • A bunch of games - both HTML5 and Flash!<br>
  • Support for custom apps.<br>
  • And possibly more!

  Light Home Brew OS is made to work on Chrome, and usually supports Firefox. No other browser is supported.
  <br>LHBOS should not be used with extensions that edit the look of websites, such as Dark Reader.
